    /* Chess allows for "en passant" captures. This occurs when a player advances
     * a pawn (p) to the opposite half of the board (rank 5 or 4), and the opposing player
     * moves a new pawn (b) two spaces forward, such that p and b are side by side. p may 
     * move forward and diagonally behind b to capture b "en passant". En passant captures 
     * must be executed immediately or the option has passed. Review Pawn.Define() for more 
     * details. This  class/object creates a marker (aka "PawnGhost") when appropriate so 
     * that en passant captures may be checked and executed.*/
